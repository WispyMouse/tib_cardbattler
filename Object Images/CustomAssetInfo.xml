	Custom object graphics should be stored in this folder.
	They must be saved as PNG files, 64 x 96 in size.
	Once placed here, you may reference these as spriteSets
	for objects you add to PremadeUnits.xml.
	
	To make your new object use a custom sprite, 
	edit the spriteSet attribute so it reads spriteSet="Custom/X", 
	where X is the name of your sprite. (E.g. if you have placed 
	an image called BlueStatue.png in Object Images, make sure 
	your new object has spriteSet="Custom/BlueStatue").
