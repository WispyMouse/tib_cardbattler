	Custom glossary maps should be stored in this folder.
	They must be saved as PNG files, with a width-height ratio
	of 1.15:1 (e.g. 4000 x 3480 or 2000 x 1740 in size).
	Once placed here, they will become available to display
	in the campaign's glossary using the mapImage attribute!
	(E.G. mapImage="Custom/My Map Name").
